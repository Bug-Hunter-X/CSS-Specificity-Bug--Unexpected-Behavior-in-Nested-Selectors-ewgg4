# CSS Specificity Bug: Unexpected Behavior in Nested Selectors

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to CSS specificity that can lead to unexpected rendering behavior. The issue lies in the interaction of multiple classes and their specificity in nested selectors.

## Bug Description
The CSS code uses nested selectors with multiple classes, aiming for a specific rendering behavior based on class combinations. However, in some browsers or situations, the expected behavior doesn't materialize due to unforeseen interactions with CSS specificity.  The `width` property does not always apply as intended.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.css` and `bugSolution.css` to view the CSS code.
3. Create an HTML file with the relevant classes to reproduce the unexpected widths.
4. Observe the rendered width of the elements. The unexpected result in `bug.css` should differ from the expected result shown in `bugSolution.css`

## Solution
The solution involves a deeper understanding of CSS specificity and carefully structuring selectors to guarantee the intended rendering.  A potential fix could involve adding more specific selectors or using !important (though generally discouraged unless absolutely necessary).
