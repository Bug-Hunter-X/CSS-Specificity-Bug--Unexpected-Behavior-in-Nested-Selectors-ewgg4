The solution involves ensuring that the specificity of the selectors is unambiguous and overrides unwanted selectors.  One approach is to increase the specificity of the intended selector, ensuring it's more precise than any potentially conflicting ones.  Another, less desirable approach is the use of `!important`, but it is often advised against due to its potential for causing maintenance problems:

```css
.container {
  width: 500px;
}

.container .item {
  width: 200px;
}

.container .item.special {
  width: 300px;
}

.container .item.special.extra-special {
  width: 400px;
}
```

This improved CSS ensures that specificity is well-managed and avoids unintended cascading issues.  The selector specificity order now accurately reflects the intended styling priority.
